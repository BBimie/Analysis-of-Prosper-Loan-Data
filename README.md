# Analysis of Prosper Loan Data
## by Temitope Bimbo Babatola


## Introduction
Prosper is a loan company. Featuring fixed-interest online loans and credit cards with next-day approval and flexible terms.
This data set contains 113,937 loans with 81 variables on each loan, including loan amount, borrower rate (or interest rate), current loan status, borrower income, and many others. 


## Objective
My main objective is to understand the parameters that determine how prosper ratings are assigned to loan applications.


## Summary of Findings

The major takeaway from this analysis is that BorrowerAPR has a significant effect on prosper ratings, the lower the APR the higher the ratings, longer term loans also increase BorrowerAPR, so it will be very beneficial to take short-term loans so to keep APR values as low as possible.
